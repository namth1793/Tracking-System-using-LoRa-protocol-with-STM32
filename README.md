# Rescue Tracking Device Using LoRa protocol With Arm-Cortex M3
## 1. Problem Statement
In recent years, the emergency communication in remote areas such as high mountain is often difficult due to lack of infrastructure. Traditional communication methods fail in these situations, delaying rescue operations and increasing the risk for those affected.
## 2. Proposed Solution
Design and build an embedded device which can tracking the location of users when they lost and transmit their locations to the rescue team by LoRa protocol.
